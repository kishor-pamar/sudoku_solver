SUDOKU-SOLVER
The aim of this project is to design and implement a Sudoku solver using digital logic written in Verilog HDL. In order to implement this solver it is necessary that the digital logic is aware of the rules of Sudoku, several key techniques for harder Sudoku and when it is necessary, how to guess values for cells in the Sudoku grid. The techniques that will be implemented include, but are not limited to, the candidate line, naked group and hidden group methods.
